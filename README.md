BitStack Analytics is a comprehensive DeFi (Decentralized Finance) smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain, providing advanced staking, governance, and analytics capabilities. The contract offers a multi-tier staking system with flexible rewards, governance mechanisms, and robust security features.

## Features

- Progressive reward multipliers and unlockable features

### 2. Flexible Staking Options

- Optional lock periods:
  - No lock: 1x reward multiplier
  - 1-month lock: 1.25x reward multiplier
  - 2-month lock: 1.5x reward multiplier
- Minimum stake amount of 1,000,000 uSTX
- 24-hour cooldown period for unstaking

### 3. Governance Mechanism

- Voting power based on staked amount
- Proposal requirements:
  - Minimum voting power of 1,000,000
  - Proposal description (10-256 characters)

### 4. Security Features

- Contract owner controls
- Emergency pause/resume functionality
- Robust error handling with specific error codes

## Contract Constants and Error Codes

### Error Codes

- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (u1000)`: Unauthorized access attempt
- `ERR-INVALID-PROTOCOL (u1001)`: Invalid protocol parameters
- `ERR-INVALID-AMOUNT (u1002)`: Invalid token amount
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-STX (u1003)`: Insufficient STX balance
- `ERR-COOLDOWN-ACTIVE (u1004)`: Cooldown period is active
- `ERR-NO-STAKE (u1005)`: No active stake found
- `ERR-BELOW-MINIMUM (u1006)`: Stake below minimum threshold
- `ERR-PAUSED (u1007)`: Contract is paused

### Key Parameters

- Base Reward Rate: 5% (500 basis points)
- Bonus Rate: 1% (100 basis points)
- Minimum Stake: 1,000,000 uSTX
- Cooldown Period: 24 hours (1,440 blocks)

## Main Functions

### Staking

- `stake-stx`: Stake STX tokens with optional lock period
- `initiate-unstake`: Begin unstaking process with cooldown
- `complete-unstake`: Finalize unstaking after cooldown

### Governance

- `create-proposal`: Create a new governance proposal
- `vote-on-proposal`: Vote on an existing proposal

### Contract Management

- `pause-contract`: Pause contract operations
- `resume-contract`: Resume contract operations

## Tier Benefits

- Basic staking
- Standard reward multiplier
- Limited features

### Tier 2

- Enhanced staking
- Increased reward multiplier
- Additional governance features

### Tier 3

- Premium staking
- Highest reward multiplier
- Full feature set

## Security Considerations

- Only contract owner can initialize and manage critical functions
- Implemented cooldown and unstaking mechanisms
- Emergency pause functionality
- Strict validation of stake amounts, lock periods, and proposals

## Installation and Deployment

1. Ensure Stacks blockchain environment is set up
2. Deploy the contract using a Stacks-compatible wallet or development tool
3. Call `initialize-contract` to set up tier levels
4. Users can begin staking and interacting with the contract
